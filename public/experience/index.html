In fact, we were not suppose to DJ that night at all and were only going to experiment with some new songs that we had found recently. As the night went on, we kept playing our hearts out and eventually, due to the South Carolina Women's Basketball Team beating LSU late in the season, many people decided to go to Jay's Bar & Grill to watch the end of the game. Sparkz and I decided to DJ until 10 o'clock that night, and it was one of my favorite DJing experiences to date.</p>

                            Taking place at TLC, my fraternity DY had a bar rental, where I set up all of our speakers on their stage. Being a Thursday night, we had high hopes for the turnout and we were correct to be excited. Hundreds of people showed up to enjoy the music I was playing and the energy was infectious. TLC is one of my favorite bars to work at because the crowd is perfect for my favorite genres of music, Pop and EDM. This night I played until 1:30 in the morning and enjoyed every second of this event. My fraternity has rentals at TLC regularly and I am there at least once a month.

                            This picture was at the end of my fraternities first bar rental of the year. Group Therapy is a bar in 5 Points in Columbia, SC and their setup is one of my favorites in the city. You enter into a wood panneled bar and walk out the back into an open air area where the DJ stand sits at the back. This night was the first time I played one of my own songs and I will remember the reaction of the crowd to this day. I cannot wait to get back to Group Therapy again soon, and have another amazing night with their superior speaker setup and amazing atmosphere.

                            This picture was taken at the end of our last fraternity rental at TLC first semester this year. We were very excited to see the crowd that night as it was one of the last nights to go out before everyone went home for Christmas Break. That night I was set up on a small plastic table, and our subwoofer was sitting under it. The crowd that night was so energetic that by the end of the night the table was nearly a foot behind the subwoofer as they had moved it with their dancing and excitement. I cannot wait for another night to set up at TLC soon.
